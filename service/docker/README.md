# ðŸš¢Â Dockerfile

There's one Dockerfile here that can be used to make images for development and production.

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** It's a security risk to include private keys in images. As a result, we've removed the old `Dockerfile.https` and `Dockerfile.https.dev`. We've also removed all the other `Dockerfile.*` files to eliminate confusion.

To build an image, run:

    docker image build --build-arg api_jar=URL --tag [OWNER/]registry-api-service:TAG .

Replace `URL` with the URL (or relative file path) to a `registry-api-service.jar` and `TAG` with the desired version tag. You can add `OWNER/` to tag the image for a specific owner, such as `nasapds/`.

The GitHub Actions configured in this repository automatically make images after each `stable-cicd.yaml` workflow (with a `:X.Y.Z` tag) and `unstable-cicd.yaml` workflow (with a `:latest` tag) and publishes them to the Docker Hub.


## ðŸ§±Â Example Builds

Building a local image:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry-api.git
$ cd registry-api
$ mvn package
$ docker image build --build-arg api_jar=service/target/registry-api-service-*.jar --tag registry-api-service:latest --file service/docker/Dockerfile .
```

Building an image from a released jar file:
```console
$ docker image build --build-arg api_jar=https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/registry-api-service-1.0.0.jar --tag nasapds/registry-api-service:1.0.0 --file service/docker/Dockerfile .
```
