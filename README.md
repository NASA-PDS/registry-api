# PDS-API-SERVICE

## Overview

This project is a template implementation of the PDS federated API using the standard libraries automatically generated from the swagger definition of the API (see repository https://github.com/nasa-pds/pds-api-core/).

It implements a very simple collections end-point complying with the specification (see https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/PDS_APIs)


## Deployment

If needed change server port and elasticSearch parameters in `src/main/resources/applications.properties`.
Note, the registry index in elasticSearch is hard-coded. It need to be `registry`.

    mvn clean
    mvn install
    mvn spring-boot:run
